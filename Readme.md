Generalised Predictive Control, GPC, is an mport implement of model predictive
control, which dates back to 1987, and was raied by Clarke et al with the
CARIMA model, please refer to
[1](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Generalized%20predictive%20control-Part%20I%20The%20basic%20algorithm)
for more details.

It's a mature technique, and have some implement in industries. There should
have some open-source implement on the Internet. But what frustrating me is
that, after a thorough search through the Ineternet, I found only matlab
implement, but no C++ implement.

Since I have something to do with this controller, I implement it with C++ from
the scratch, wasting a few days. The experimental results aren't satisfactory
though.


I upload to github, in case somebody else need it. It's an reference, and I
cannot garantee the correctness of the code. Some features in the code aren't
implemented, and there are some implement are quite awful, I see. I don't want
to waste my time to correct or improve it anyway.

3. GPC-C++-Implementation


I hope this code will help somebody, and if so, it'll be kind of you to let me
know [Troy_Daniel](mailto:Troy_Daniel@163.com).


You can distribute it, and opensource is great, I hope you shall make your code
open-acessible if possible.
